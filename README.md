# ecommerce-negotiator-chatbot Vervebridge
A  Ecommerce price negotiation chatbot 

This project is an ecommerce negotiator chatbot designed for e-commerce platforms. The chatbot provides instant, accurate responses to user queries, enhancing the user experience and streamlining customer support. The project integrates machine learning with a graphical user interface and a database to manage conversations.

### Key Features

- *AI-Powered Responses*: Uses a neural network model built with PyTorch to understand and respond to user inputs with high accuracy.
- *Database Integration*: Conversations are stored in a MySQL database for analysis and improvement.
- *User Interface*: Provides an interactive chat interface using Tkinter for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- *Backend:*
  - Python
  - PyTorch
  - MySQL

- *Frontend:*
  - Tkinter (for UI)

## Files

- chat.py: Main script to run the chatbot with Tkinter UI and MySQL integration.
- data.pth: Saved model state and metadata (deprecated).
- data.nego.pth: Latest model state and metadata.
- intent.json: JSON file containing chatbot intents and responses.
- model.py: Contains the definition of the neural network model.
- nltk_utils.py: Contains utility functions for tokenizing and processing text.
- train.py: Script for training the chatbot model.

## Installation and Setup

1. *Clone the repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ecommerce_faq_chatbot.git
   cd ecommerce_faq_chatbot
## Setup Evn

1. **Set up the virtual environment:**
   bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

## *Set up the database:*
   - Create a MySQL database named chatbot.
   - Create a table named interactions with the following columns:
       - id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
       - user_input (TEXT)
       - bot_response (TEXT)
       - timestamp (DATETIME)
    
## *Configure the application:*
  - Update the database connection settings in chat.py if necessary.

## *Run the chatbot:*
    ```bash
    python train.py
    python chat.py
## *How It Works:*
  - *Training*: The train.py script trains the neural network model using the dataset provided in intent.json. The trained model is saved as data_Nego.pth.
  - *Chat Interface*: The chat.py script loads the trained model and provides a Tkinter-based chat interface. User interactions are processed, and responses are generated based on the modelâ€™s predictions.
  - *Database Logging*: Conversations between users and the chatbot are logged into the MySQL database for record-keeping and analysis.
